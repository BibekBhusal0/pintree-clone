## More changes you can make

### If you don't want to change new tab you can change bookmarks page

1. Change manifest.json file

```diff
    ...
  "chrome_url_overrides": {
-    "newtab": "index.html"
+    "bookmarks": "index.html"
  },
  "permissions": ["bookmarks", "favicon", "readingList", "tabs"]

```

2. Change popup.js file

```diff
-   const url = "chrome://newtab";
+   const url = "chrome://bookmarks";

    const openLink = () => {
        chrome.tabs.create({ url });
    };

    document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", openLink);
```

this will not change new tab but instead change chrome://bookmarks page

### You can remove reading list to be included in folders

```diff
    const getBookmarks = async () => {
      const allBookmarks = await chrome.bookmarks.getTree();
-      const readingList = await chrome.readingList.query({});
-      if (readingList) {
-        if (readingList.length > 0) {
-          allBookmarks[0].children.push({
-            title: "Reading List",
-            children: readingList,
-          });
-        }
-      }
      return allBookmarks;
    };

```
